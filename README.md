## Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming

There are basically three core learning outcomes today, and with any luck, a bunch of interesting bonus stuff.

### Core Learning Outcomes

* Callbacks - What are those again?
* How's setTimeout work?
* How do basic file reads and writes work?
*
### Bonus Learning Outcomes

* What's the difference between "synchronous" and "asynchronous?"
* What is Javascript for? (What was it created for?)
* Why do we care about how setTimeout and file reads/writes work?
* Terminology breakdown: Asynchronous, concurrent, parallel
* Buttons: A case study in asynchrony
* Simulating concurrent processes
* How do we use what we learned about `setTimeout` to understand other asynchronous programming? (e.g. network requests)
